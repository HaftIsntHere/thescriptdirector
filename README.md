# The script redirector
This "hub" redirects you to keys, I made an hub (with buttons) and auto execute version, which is just executed, no questions asked


## Scripts

### The hub
The hub includes a nice ui and you can execute the scripts on any game
Script: ```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaftIsntHere/thescriptdirector/main/Auto%20Execute.txt"))()```

### Auto execute
basically executes the script automatically
Script: ```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaftIsntHere/thescriptdirector/main/Auto%20Execute.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaftIsntHere/thescriptdirector/main/thehub.txt"))()```

### Lua Ware Auto Execute
Basically the auto execute, but only uses luaWare scripts
Script: ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaftIsntHere/thescriptdirector/main/Lua%20Ware%20Autoexec.txt```
